\subsection{}
The appendix is an optional section that can contain details and data supplemental to the main text---for example, explanations of experimental details that would disrupt the flow of the main text but nonetheless remain crucial to understanding and reproducing the research shown; figures of replicates for experiments of which representative data are shown in the main text can be added here if brief, or as Supplementary Data. Mathematical proofs of results not central to the paper can be added as an appendix.

%\tablesize{} % You can specify the fontsize here, e.g., \tablesize{\footnotesize}. If commented out \small will be used.

All appendix sections must be cited in the main text. In the appendices, Figures, Tables, etc. should be labeled, starting with ``A''---e.g., Figure A1, Figure A2, etc.
